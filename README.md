# Bubble sort algorithm ðŸ«§

Bubble sort ðŸ«§ is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is a comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and swapped if they are not in the desired order. This algorithm is not optimal for large data sets because the mean and worst case complexity is equal to (ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items to be sorted.
